# Personalized Healthcare Recommendations - ML Project 

This project builds a **Machine Learning-based system** that provides **personalized healthcare recommendations** based on patient health data. It uses blood donation history (like Recency, Frequency, etc.) to predict whether a patient needs medical attention or is likely healthy.

-----------

##  What This Project Does

- Loads and processes patient data from `blood.csv`
- Uses **feature scaling** to prepare numerical features
- Trains and compares multiple ML models:
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Tunes the best model using **GridSearchCV**
- Visualizes class distribution using bar and pie charts
- Generates a personalized recommendation for a new patient
- Prints prediction confidence and model accuracy reports
- Times the full program execution ‚è±

##  Example Data Fields

| Feature   | Description                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Recency   | Months since the last blood donation             |
| Frequency | Total number of donations                        |
| Monetary  | Blood volume donated                             |
| Time      | Months since the first donation                  |
| Class     | 0 = Healthy, 1 = Requires Attention (Label)      |
